# Shiny Application

# Option 3

**Shiny App**: I chose to continue developing my shiny application for this assignment. I have added several new features, such as navigation pages, radio buttons, an interactive plot, and several reactive text expressions. I have also added a theme which makes the application more aesthetically pleasing.

# App Description

This is a simple yet fun application. The "About" page orients the user to what the application's purpose is and provides a brief instructional description of the other two pages of the application. The "Table" page enables the user to select a country in order to explore the related data and provides a feature to download the data as a csv file. The "Plot" page enables the user to visualize data in the form of a scatterplot: they can choose which country they would like to explore and then select the predictor variable and criterion variable from the radio buttons in the sidebar pannel. Additionally, there are helpful reactive text displays above both the table as well as plot, reminder users which options they have select. Lastly, there is a lovely and relevant image of the world at the top of the sidebar which breathes aesthetic life into the app and conjours up an image in the user's mind of exploring the world, which certainly adds to the user experience.
