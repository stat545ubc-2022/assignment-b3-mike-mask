# Shiny Application

Please check out my Shiny App [here](https://mike-mask.shinyapps.io/shiny_app_mike/).

# Option B

I chose Option B to make my own Shiny App.

# App Description

This is just the beginning of the app: it is a fun application to learn more about the countries of the world, such as what continent they are in and what the population, life expectancy and GDP per capita are in a given year. The app allows the user to easily select which country's data they are interested in exploring by selecting the country in the sidebar. The app also enables users to easily download the data that is being displayed. Lastly, there is a lovely and relevant image of the world at the top which breathes aesthetic life into the app and conjours up an image in the user's mind of exploring the world, which certainly adds to the user experience.
